## Section A: Preparing the Local wallet

1. Download most recent Lobstex wallet from https://github.com/avymantech/lobstex/releases/tag/v2.0                           
   to your LOCAL system 

	a. If Windows firewall blocks the wallet, it is safe to allow 
		
		Generate your Masternode's Private Key 
	
		Go to the "Tools" dropdown and select "Debug Console" 

	



	b.	Type this command into the console 
              
	      		masternode genkey
			
	
	c.	Save GENKEY on NOTEPAD/NOTES


 

2. Generate Masternode address and name it

a. Still in the Debug Console, enter this command, replacing "YourMasternodeName" with the name you want for your Masternode. 
              
	      getaccountaddress YourMasternodeName 

		(ex. getaccountaddress mynode) 
		
		
3. Send 10,000 LOBS to the wallet address you generated

a. Copy the address you generated in the last step EXACTLY. We CAN NOT help
anyone who has sent their LOBS to the wrong address.

b. You can verify it is the correct address when you paste it into the "Pay to:" field,
the "Label" field should autopopulate to your Masternode's name.



4. Get proof of transaction to the Masternode

a. Enter this command into the Debug Console

               `masternode outputs` 

This can take a second
 

Type the command below and press enter 

   

* Copy the long key (this is your transaction ID) and the 0 or 1 at the end (this is your output index)
* Paste these into the text document you created earlier as you will need them in the next step.
